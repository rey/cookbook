# Tomato and coriander salad

## About

I make this salad  fairly regularly and often throw other things in it.

TODO: Remember to take a photo before I eat all of the salad.

## Ingredients

* Tomato (3, diced)
* Garlic (3 cloves, halved lengthways then sliced super fine)
* Coriander (a handful, chopped fine)
* Capers (pickled, 1 tbsp)
* Olive oil (a decent drizzle)
* Balsamic vinegar (a decent drizzle)
* Salt & pepper

## Instruction

Add all the ingredients and give it a good, gentle mix.

## Serving suggestion that I totally just had for lunch

1. Toast 2 thickly cut slices of bread
2. Cut the slices into mouth sized pieces
3. Get a dressed crab and your bowl of salad
4. Put some crab on a piece of bread, followed by a spoonful of salad
5. Put it in your face
6. Repeat until finished
