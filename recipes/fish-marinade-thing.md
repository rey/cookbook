## About

At home I eat a fair amount of meat which isn't particular good for you. I'm trying to wean myself off by eating more delicious fish. Here is a recipe I invented which for the barbecue but imagine would work just as well in the oven.

## Ingredients

* Fish (2, filleted, I used mackerel)
* Ginger (1 inch, grated)[^1]
* Red chilli (1, diced)
* Garlic (2/3 cloves, minced)
* Olive oil (a glug)
* Lime (2, juiced)
* Fresh coriander (a bunch, chopped)
* Fresh parsley (a bunch, chopped)
* Salt + pepper

## Step 1: Prepare the marinade

1. Take a bowl and add the ginger, chilli, garlic, olive oil, lime juice and the chopped herbs.
2. Add some salt and pepper and give it a good stir.

## Step 2: Marinate the fish

1. Take a baking tray (or whatever the fish are going to marinate in) and place the fillets skin down.
2. Using your hands, take wads of the marinade and gently coat the fillets. Take care to evenly coat them with the deliciousness.
3. Once done, cover the baking tray with cling film and stick them in the fridge for a couple of hours.

## Step 3: Cook the fish!

1. Again, I made these with the intent to stick them on the barbecue. I happened to have these [Aluminium Cook Pans](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Landmann-0249-Aluminium-Cook-Pans/dp/B000TAPAAQ/) in the kitchen so took one of those, drizzled a bit of olive oil on it and added the fillets.[^2]
2. I cooked the fillets until the flesh has just turned from raw to cooked and skin was crisping up. You don't need to turn them!

I think I used more than an inch of ginger when I made this but I'm loving the ginger at the moment so probably went a bit overboard.

Could you put them in one of those [fish grill things](http://www.amazon.co.uk/BBQ-Master-Fish-Basket/dp/B0030BN0GM/)? Probably, but I'm not that fancy.
