## About

This is an amazing salsa that I make in large batches then bag up to freeze. It can be eaten with tortilla chips but is usually put in chilli, curry, casserole, etc.

## Ingredients

* 2 limes, juiced
* 1 bulb of garlic, crushed
* 0.5 inch of ginger, grated
* 2 medium/large white onions, roughly chopped
* 1 medium/large red onion, roughly chopped
* 6-8 medium tomatoes, roughly chopped
* 0.5 bunch of parsley, roughly chopped
* 1 bunch of coriander, roughly chopped
* 1 large red chilli, deseeded and chopped up
* Tin of chopped tomatoes
* Balsamic vinegar, a decent slug
* Salt + pepper

## Instructions

1. Throw all the ingredients into a large bowl
2. Blend with one of those [hand blender things](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Russell-Hobbs-Collection-14452-Ergonomic/dp/B001B9BIBY/)
3. Taste
4. Add anything you think is missing :)
