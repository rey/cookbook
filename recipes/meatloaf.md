## About

I adapted this recipe from a generic one I found on the internet. That explains the half ingredients which makes my OCD twitch.

## Ingredients

* 500g of mince
* 1 small onion, minced
* 4 decent cloves of garlic, minced
* 1.5 slices of bread, toasted and crumbed
* 3.5 Jacob's crackers, crushed
* 1 egg, lightly beaten
* 1 tablespoon of butter
* Tin of tomatoes
* Tomato purée, a good splodge
* tomato ketchup, a squirt
* Worcester sauce, 2/3 generous glugs
* 1 teaspoon of cumin
* 1 teaspoon of paprika
* 2 heaped tablespoons of sour cream
* Salt + pepper

## Instructions

0. Preheat the oven to 200°C
1. Take a pan and stick it on a medium heat with that tablespoon of butter. Once melted throw in the onions and garlic and cook until the onions are soft and golden brown.
2. Take a large mixing bowl and add the onions/garlic from the pan (make sure you get all that melted butter in there). 
3. Next add the lightly beaten egg, mince, toast crumbs, crushed crackers, about a third of the tin of tomatoes, Worcester sauce, sour cream, cumin, paprika and the salt and pepper.
4. Stir it thoroughly. I suspect this is what makes it a success. STIR!
5. Spoon the delicious mixture into a nonstick loaf tin. Put it aside to settle for a bit whilst you...
6. Take a small pan, tip in the rest of the tin of tomatoes, a good splodge of tomato purée and a squirt of tomato ketchup. Chuck in some Worcester sauce for good measure and put on a low, low heat.
7. Stick the meat loaf in the oven. I found it took an hour to get to an internal temperature of 70°C which is what you're after. Keep an eye on it, though.
8. After you're at 70°C, remove from the oven, spoon the tomato sauce evenly over the loaf. Crack some black pepper over it then return to the oven for 10 minutes.
9. Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 5 minutes then put in face.
