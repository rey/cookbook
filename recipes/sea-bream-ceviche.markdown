## About

I used this ceviche recipe [from Serious
Eats](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/07/classic-peruvian-style-fish-ceviche-recipe.html)
for reference, but the measures below are what I used to make ceviche for two humans.

Recommend serving with slices of toasted ciabatta.

## Ingredients

* Fresh lime (2, juicy + juiced)
* Red chilli (1, deseeded, diced)
* Sea bream (1, medium-large, filleted, skin removed, pin boned and cut into 1cm-ish cubes)
* Coriander (small handful, chopped fine)
* Your favourite hot sauce (a brief dash)
* Red onion (half, diced)
* Salt and pepper

## Instructions

1. Squeeze your limes into a decent-sized bowl, making sure you get as much of the juice as possible
2. Throw in the red chilli, hot sauce[^1] and season with salt and pepper. Give it a good stir and put in the fridge[^2] whilst you...
3. Prepare the sea bream fillets[^3].
4. Add the sea bream to the marinade, followed by the coriander[^4].
5. Give the mixture a good, gentle stir then cover and stick in the fridge for half an hour, stirring again halfway through.

[^1]: Hot sauce gives the marinade a bit more body.
[^2]: I prepared the lime/chilli/hot sauce before the fish to give the lime some time to work on the chilli.
[^3]: Removing the skin from a fish fillet isn't difficult and a pair of tweezers is useful for pin boning.
[^4]: Add the coriander with the sea bream to prevent the fresh herbs from discolouring.
