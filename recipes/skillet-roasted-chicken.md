## About

I own [a cast iron skillet](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00006JSUA) and [it's awesome](http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/06/how-to-buy-season-clean-maintain-cast-iron-pans.html). I've roasted many a chicken based on [this technique found on the NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/dining/a-new-breed-of-roast-chicken-cast-iron-seared.html). Here is how I do mine.   

## Ingredients

* Chicken (I usually get a chicken weighing around 1.2 - 1.3 kilograms[^1]. I find this fits nicely in my skillet with a bit of extra room)
* Bay leaves (2)
* Thyme (a bunch)
* Garlic (4 cloves, gently crushed)
* Olive oil
* Chilli oil (or Tabasco/whatever takes your fancy)

## Step 1: Prepare the chicken

0. Check the chicken fits in the skillet.
1. Splay the chicken's legs so to spread eagle them.
2. Take 2 cloves of the crushed garlic and place them where you made the cuts to splay the chicken[^2].
3. Stick the bunch of thyme, bay leaves and other 2 cloves of the crushed garlic in the chicken cavity.

## Step 2: Cook the chicken!

1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. When the oven is at the correct temperature, whack a glug of olive oil in the pan and stick it in the oven to preheat the pan.
3. Once the oil is hot and smoking slightly place the chicken in the pan[^3].
4. Drizzle the chilli oil over the chicken and season with salt and pepper.
4. Cook for around 45 minutes to an hour, checking every 15 minutes or so. If the chicken looks like it's starting to burn then cover loosely with tin foil.
5. Leave to rest for 10 minutes then serve.

### Notes

[^1]:
I find this chicken weight fits nicely in my skillet with a bit of extra room. Your mileage may vary.

[^2]:
I have no idea why I do this but I find the chicken tastes nicer than it does if I don't do it.

[^3]:
Push the splayed chicken legs against when pan so they sear. Careful! The skillet gets very hot.
