# Turkey steak Marinade

## About

This is a cheeky marinade that I threw together for some turkey steaks that had been defrosted and I was really happy the way they came out. Although I used turkey, I think this would also be nice with pork (tenderloin, perhaps?)

## Ingredients

* Turkey steak (3)
* Soy sauce (a generous slug)
* Worcester sauce (a generous slug)
* Olive oil (a generous slug)
* Lime (1, juiced)
* Bourbon (a capful)
* Brown sugar (1 tsp, maybe a little less)
* Garlic (5/6 cloves, crushed)
* Home made pickled onions (3, finely sliced) or you could use shallots
* [Dried mixed herbs](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Mixed_Herbs) (1 tsp)
* Salt + pepper

## Prepare the marinade

1. Throw everything in a decent sized bowl and give it a good stir until the sugar has dissolved.
2. Take the steaks and (using your hands!) turn them in the marinade and make sure they're nice and coated.
3. Cover the bowl in cling film and leave for fair few hours (I left them for the best part of an afternoon) in the fridge.

## Cook the steaks!

1. Take each steak, gently remove the bigger pieces of garlic and onion then pat dry.
2. Preheat a griddle pan to magma, add a dash of oil and throw the turkey steaks on. Grill for a couple of minutes either side (check out those grill lines, oh yes).
3. Leave to rest for 5 minutes or so.
4. Slice into inch thick stripes and place on top of a delicious stir fry (or whatever, it's your food).
