## About

I made this recipe up as I went along and was very pleased with the outcome.

You're going to need a decent pair of kitchen scissors for the spatchcocking
and a cast iron skillet for the cooking.

## Ingredients

* Chicken (about 1.8kg)
* Fresh ginger (3 inches, grated then squeezed to get the ginger juice)
* Fresh garlic (4/5 cloves, minced)
* Soy sauce (a decent glug)
* Worcestershire sauce (a decent glug)
* Olive oil (a decent glug)
* Tabasco (5 dots)
* Brown sugar (1 tsp)
* Salt and pepper
* Handful of potatoes (peeled)
* Handful of carrots (peeled)

## Step 1: Prepare the marinade

1. Preheat your oven to 220°C.
2. Spatchcock your chicken (this is quite easy, [here's a video showing you how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppa1bxB89vg)).
3. Get a decent-sized casserole dish that will fit your chicken.
4. Add the ginger juice, garlic, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, tabasco, salt and pepper.
5. Give it a good mix.
6. Add your chicken and use your human hands to give it a good mix in the marinade.
7. Keep going! [You want it covered](https://www.flickr.com/photos/reyhan/15449019885/).
8. Leave it to marinate for at least a couple of hours in the fridge, skin side down.

## Step 2: Cook the chicken

1. Take your skillet and throw in the potatoes and carrots, place the chicken on top ensuring there are no limbs hanging out the edges of the pan.
2. Throw some freshly ground pepper on there because #yolo.
3. Put the skillet in the middle shelf in your oven for 20 minutes then turn it down to 200°C.
4. Cook for 45 minutes to 1 hour.

## Step 3: Make the glaze

1. Take the leftover marinade, add it to a small saucepan with a cup of water.
2. Add the brown sugar.
3. Bring to the boil then simmer to reduce until it thickens up.

## Step 4: Whilst cooking

Every 15 minutes or so I glazed the chicken and occasionally basted it with the juices from pan.
