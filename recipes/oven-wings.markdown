Wings I made for lunch club.

## Ingredients

* Chicken wings (12)
* Red onion (1, minced)
* Olive oil (a decent glug)
* Paprika (1 tsp)
* Cumin (1 tsp)
* Ground coriander (1 tsp)
* Fresh coriander (handful, chopped fine)
* Garlic (4 cloves, minced)

* Tomato ketchup (a decent squirt)
* Fresh lime (2, juiced)
* Balsamic vinegar (a glug)
* Fresh ginger (juiced)
* Tabasco (couple of shakes)
* Salt + pepper

## Instructions

1. Combine all the ingredients in a box that you can seal.
2. Mix every now and then (or do what I did and just turn it upside down and stick it back in the fridge).
3. Stick in the oven at 180 degrees Celsius and turn every 15 minutes.
