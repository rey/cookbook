# Camping corned beef stew

## About

I wanted to create a no-fuss stew that could be made without the need for fresh meat. I'm using corned beef and this recipe will feed 2/3 hungry folk.

I'm really happy with how this turned out, you should eat this outdoors on a cool evening with crusty bread.

## Ingredients

* Tin of corned beef (340g)[^1]
* Onion (1, medium, sliced)
* Garlic (half a bulb, peeled, sliced or crushed)
* Ginger (~2 inches, grated, delicious)
* New potatoes (a good handful, halved or quartered depending on the size)
* Carrots (2, medium, sliced)
* Red chilli (1, deseeded, sliced)
* Olive oil (a glug)
* Worcestershire sauce (a glug)
* Balsamic vinegar (a glug)
* Cumin (0.5 tsp)
* Paprika (1 tps)
* Tin of chopped tomatoes
* Tomato purée (a good splodge)
* Fresh thyme (a bunch, tied as a bundle)
* Bay leaf (1)
* Salt + pepper
* Optional: red wine ( a glug)

## Instructions

1. Slice up the onion, garlic, potatoes, carrot and grate your ginger
2. Take a medium sized saucepan, throw in that glug of olive oil and preheat on a medium flame
3. Once the oil is hot, chuck in the onion, garlic and ginger. Fry those for a bit
4. Cut the chilli in half, remove the seeds then slice
5. Once the onion, garlic and ginger have begun to go soft, add the chilli, cumin and paprika and give it a good stir
6. Turn it down a tad and put the lid on. You want to cook until the mixture turns _sticky_
7. We're only using half the corned beef so choose a half and slice up
8. Once the mixture has reached that sticky consistency, add the corned beef and a glug of Worcestershire sauce. Stir well and cover for 5 minutes
9. Add a good splodge of tomato purée, a tin of tomatoes, a can of water, a glug of balsamic vinegar and the carrots and potatoes. If you have any red wine stick that in, too
10. Season with salt and pepper
11. Whack in the bundle of thyme and bay leaf, stir gently and cover

Simmer until the vegetables have cooked through -- I ended up reducing the stew before serving to thicken and concentrate the flavour.

[^1]:
Although the recipe asks for a full can of corned beef, the recipe only uses half so you could use one of those half cans if you like.
